# Spam-SMS-Detection

**Project Title:** Spam SMS Detection with Imbalanced Dataset Handling

**Description:**
Led project focused on detecting spam SMS using machine learning techniques. Handled imbalanced dataset to ensure model accuracy. Implemented feature engineering by counting SMS length and examining the distribution of word count in spam and ham messages. Identified and counted currency symbols in SMS and analyzed their relationship with spam and ham classifications. Explored the presence of numbers in SMS and engineered a feature based on their occurrence, examining their correlation with spam and ham messages.

Utilized natural language processing techniques with the NLTK and re libraries, including stopword removal, lemmatization with WordNetLemmatizer, and SMS cleaning. Employed TF-IDF vectorizer to transform the data into numerical format suitable for machine learning. Trained a Naive Bayes model on the preprocessed data to classify SMS into spam and ham categories.

**Results:**
1. Improved model performance by handling imbalanced dataset, ensuring accurate classification of spam and ham SMS.
2. Identified key features such as SMS length, word count distribution, currency symbols, and numbers presence, contributing to effective spam detection.
3. Leveraged natural language processing techniques to preprocess SMS data, enhancing model interpretability and performance.
4. Successfully trained and deployed a Naive Bayes classifier for accurate spam SMS detection, enabling efficient filtering of unwanted messages.
